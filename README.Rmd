> The _Extensible_ TMLE framework

__Author:__ [Jeremy Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle)

## What's `tmle3`?

`tmle3` is a general framework that supports the implementation of a range of
Targeted Maximum Likelihood / Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE) parameters
through exposing a unified interface. The goal is that the `tmle3` framework
be as general as the mathematical framework upon which it's based.

For a general discussion of the framework of targeted minimum loss-based
estimation and the role this methodology plays in statistical and causal
inference, the canonical references are @vdl2011targeted and @vdl2018targeted.
